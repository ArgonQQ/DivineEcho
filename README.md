## What This Is

A glorified log-watcher with a GUI. It sits politely in the corner, waiting for PoE2 to log someone whispering “Hi, I’d like to buy your…” and immediately pings your Telegram like your social life depends on it. Which, in this case, it might.

## Features

- Forwards trade whispers to Telegram faster than you can Alt-Tab
- Simple desktop GUI to edit config files because typing is hard
- Cross-platform: works on Windows and macOS
